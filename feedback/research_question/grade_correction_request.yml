corrections:
- component: partE writing
  current_mark: Little of Merit
  correct_mark: Excellent
  reason: |
    The reason we are requesting the grade correction is because in the partE writing part of the feedback, it is mentioned that "studyweek" is spelled incorrectly. However, in our research question as well as in our hypotheses, we did not used the word "studyweek". studyweek is the independent variable and it is mentioned as is against the independent-var key in the research_question.yml file. It is therefore requested to kindly review this part of the assignment.
